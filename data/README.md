# Raw Labeled Data

This folder contains the raw labeled data used for my master's thesis project.

## Contents

The data files in this folder contain manually labeled statements extracted with papercheck in R (see script X).

Each statement was reviewed and labeled according to whether the interpretation of a nonsignificant p value was correct (0) or incorrect (1).

See the second sheet titled 'codebook' in 'labeled_data.xlsx'for more details.
